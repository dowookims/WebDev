      Santa tell me if you're really there
      Don't make me fall in love again
      If he won't be here next year
      Santa tell me if he really cares
      'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year
      Feeling Christmas all around
      And I'm trying to play it cool
      But it's hard to focus when I see you walking around the room
      Let it snow, it's blasting now
      But I won't get in the mood
      I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
      It's true love that he thinks of
      So next Christmas
      I'm not all alone, boy
      Santa, tell me if you're really there
      Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
      Next year
      Santa, tell me if he really cares
      'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
      Next year
      I've been down this road before
      Fell in love on Christmas night
      But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
      Now I need someone to hold
      Be my fire in the cold
      But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
      Or if it's true love that he thinks of
      So next Christmas
      I'm not all alone, babe
      Santa, tell me if you're really there
      Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
      Next year
      Santa, tell me if he really cares
      'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
      Next year
      Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
      On the 25th by the fire place, oh-oh-oh
      But I don't want no broken heart
      This year I've got to be smart
      Oh, baby
      If you want me, if you want me
      Santa, tell me if you're really there
      Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
      Next year
      Santa, tell me if he really cares
      'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
      Next year
      Santa, tell me if you're really there
      Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here
      Next year
      Santa, tell me if he really cares
      'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here
      Next year
