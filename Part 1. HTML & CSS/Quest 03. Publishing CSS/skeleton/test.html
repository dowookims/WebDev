  <pre>I could lavish my life,
      With a bed of silken fallacies
      But underneath are rotten springs
      I'm starting to see
      Facades that we fabricate
      Slowly crumbling away
      No guarantee that I'll be strong
      And I guarantee my pride is singing this song
      And I'm scared to show my little black box
      But it's all for you (2nd time "And" instead of "But")
      This little light will go away if I won't be real
      This little light will run away if I don't tell you how I feel
      Little light please stay don't stray
      Help me to tolerate myself, myself, myself,
      'Cause I feel so vain
      I am bright as the sun,
      With a crimson heat so blackening
      And at the core the cool's shut in
      The sun knows it's time to set
      And to draw a close
      My memory just won't comply
      No guarantee that I'll be strong
      And I guarantee my pride is singing this song
      And I'm scared to show my little black box
      And it's all for you
      This little light will go away if I won't be real
      This little light will run away if I don't tell you how I feel
      Little light please stay don't stray
      Help me to tolerate myself, myself, myself,
      'Cause I feel so vain
      This little light will go away if I won't be real
      This little light will run away if I don't tell you how I feel
      Little light please stay don't stray
      Help me to tolerate myself, myself, myself,
      'Cause I feel so vain
